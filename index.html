    The HyperText Markup Language</a></strong> or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed
    to be displayed in a web browser. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets
    (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

    Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the
    documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and
    originally included cues for its appearance.
